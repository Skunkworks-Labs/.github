## Folder Structure
solution-1/ ├── backend/ │ └── server.js # Node.js + Express.js backend └── frontend/ └── App.js # React Native frontend

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** (included with Node.js)
- **React Native CLI** installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g react-native-cli
Android Studio or Xcode for mobile development (required to run on Android/iOS simulators or physical devices).
Backend Setup (Node.js + Express.js)
